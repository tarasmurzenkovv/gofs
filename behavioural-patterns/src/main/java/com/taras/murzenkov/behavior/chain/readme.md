**GoF Definition**

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a
chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an
object handles it.

**Concept**

Here we process a series of objects one by one (i.e., in a sequential manner). A source will initiate this
processing. With this pattern, we constitute a chain where each of the processing objects can have some logic
to handle a particular type of command object. After oneâ€™s processing is done, if anything is still pending, it
can be forwarded to the next object in the chain. We can add new objects anytime at the end of a chain.
