**GoF Definition**

Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. The visitor
pattern lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

**Concept**

This pattern helps us to add new functionalities to an existing object structure in such a way that the old
structure remains unaffected by these changes. So, we can follow the open/close principle here
(i.e., extension allowed but modification disallowed for entities like class, function, modules, etc.).
